# Signal Processing

Project for the MATH-458 course.

## Setting up
In order to set up the project, it is necessary to 'make' the `CmakeLists.txt` filed.

## User guide


## Limitations & Future Improvements
Currently the code is not set up to deal with signals whose length is not a power of 2 (due to the specific
implementation of the FFT). Furthermore it is only set up to work with mono signals.
